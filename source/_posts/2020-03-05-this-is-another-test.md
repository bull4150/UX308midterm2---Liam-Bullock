**Everybody** is Logic's third studio album and home to arguably his most recognized and famous song _1-800-273-8255_. This song being the number for the suicide hotline gained a ton of traction for the much anticipated album. The album is the story how Logic is both black and white and being able to see life from two sides. The whole album is about cultural evolution.
